libpgp-sign-perl (1.00-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Drop support for all PGP implementations other than GnuPG.
    - Add a new object-oriented API that avoids global variables.  The old
      API is still supported, implemented as a shim over the new API.
    - Add support for GnuPG v2.
    - Separate status output from logging when running GnuPG.
    - Pass --allow-weak-digest-algos with GnuPG v1 for better backwards
      compatibility with PGP 2.6.2.
    - pgp_sign in array context now always returns "GnuPG" as the PGP
      version.
    - pgp_verify now ignores the version parameter.
    - Fix whitespace munging with pgp_sign when called again with new data
      after finishing signing data with trailing whitespace without a
      newline.
    - Use IPC::Run and File::Temp instead of hand-rolled equivalents.
  * Update standards version to 4.5.0.
    - Install Changes as NEWS.gz instead of changelog.gz since it is now
      release notes rather than a detailed changelog.
    - Use https for the Format field of debian/copyright.
    - Add Rules-Requires-Root: no.

libpgp-sign-perl (0.20-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upstream doesn't (yet) work with GnuPG v2, so pin the dependencies at
    GnuPG v1 for now and force use of gpg1 as the signing and verification
    program.  (Closes: #835773)
  * Sync packaging with the orig tarball currently in Debian.  This is a
    bit of a mess at the moment (the orig tarball in Debian contains a lot
    of stuff it shouldn't and is missing some files), but none of the
    problems should matter for the Debian build.  This will be cleaned up
    properly with the next upstream release.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} dependency.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.8.
    - Remove ancient, formerly-required versioned dependency on Perl.
    - Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.
    - Reference GPL v1 (due to Perl license) instead of the symlink.
    - Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Switch to Debian source package format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Add module name to the package long description.
  * Merge Build-Depends-Indep into Build-Depends, since this distinction
    is not useful when only building Architecture: all packages.
  * Add debian/gbp.conf reflecting the branch layout of the default
    packaging repository.
  * Run wrap-and-sort -ast on the packaging files.
  * Use https for the Homepage URL.
  * Add signature verification to debian/watch and update the URL.
