                      User-Visible PGP::Sign Changes

PGP::Sign 1.00 (unreleased)

    Drop support for all PGP implementations other than GnuPG.  I haven't
    seen a working copy of the old commercial PGP implementations in years
    and no longer have any way to test PGP::Sign with them.

    PGP::Sign now depends on IPC::Run and uses it to talk to GnuPG instead
    of hand-rolling equivalent functionality with IPC::Open3.

    Use File::Temp to create temporary files.  This should significantly
    improve the safety of temporary file creation.  The default directory
    for temporary file creation is now whatever directory File::Temp
    chooses by default.  It can stll be overridden by setting
    $PGP::Sign::TMPDIR.

    Pass --allow-weak-digest-algos to pgp_sign and pgp_verify so that they
    can use old keys and verify signatures from old keys, such as those
    created with PGP 2.6.2.

    When calling pgp_sign multiple times in the same process with
    whitespace munging enabled, trailing whitespace without a newline
    could have leaked into the next invocation of pgp_sign, resulting in
    an invalid signature.  Clear any remembered whitespace between
    pgp_sign invocations.

    Require a minimum Perl version of 5.20 and stop attempting to support
    versions of Perl back to 5.003, which are now impossible to test with
    and are missing many modern Perl features.

    Rewrite the build system to use Module::Build.  This eliminates the
    spurious VERSION.pm "module" at the top level, which was a hack for
    setting the distribution version in old versions of
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker and should improve the indexing of the module.
    Move the module into a lib structure and the test suite data into
    t/data.  Eliminate all of the prompting and command-line parameters to
    set the PGP style and path to programs; this will instead be
    discovered or configured at runtime.

    Rewrite ChangeLog into a more conventional Changes file.

PGP::Sign 0.20 (2007-04-27)

    Unbuffer output when building the module since there is an interactive
    prompt.

PGP::Sign 0.19 (2004-08-08)

    Replace verification code for GnuPG with code that uses --status-fd,
    so that it will work independent of locale.

    Document limitations in the error reporting and recommended setting
    TMPDIR.

PGP::Sign 0.18 (2004-08-04)

    Remove trustdb.gpg from the distribution and add it to the files
    cleaned by make clean.

PGP::Sign 0.17 (2002-06-28)

    Skip the test for verification of data with trailing whitespace when
    run under GnuPG, since the whitespace behavior changes fromr elease to
    release.  GnuPG 1.0.2 is back to the previous behavior of releases
    before GnuPG 1.0.1.

    Update CAVEATS to be slightly less optimistic about the chances of a
    major overhaul.  Add a URL for RFC 2440 and this module's web site.
    Add a COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section.  Update the markup in the
    documentation.

PGP::Sign 0.16 (2000-02-12)

    Add support for PGP 6.5, including a new PGPSTYLE setting.

    Add a waitpid call to pgp_verify() to avoid leaving zombies behind.

    Document the change in trailing whitespace handling in GnuPG 1.0.1.

PGP::Sign 0.15 (1999-06-13)

    Clear the close-on-exec flag on the passphrase pipe in pgp_sign(),
    required for Perl 5.005_03.

    Document that PGP may want to write randseed.bin to its keyring
    directory when run.

PGP::Sign 0.14 (1999-02-10)

    Add support for GnuPG and PGP 5.0.  This includes a new PGPSTYLE
    global variable, support for separate programs for signing and
    verification and lots of choosing between styles all over the code.
    Document the incompatibilities between different versions with respect
    to whitespace munging.

    Add support for passing overrides for PGP paths and PGPSTYLE
    configuration settings via a paths file in the top-level directory
    instead of on the command line of makepm.PL.

PGP::Sign 0.13 (1998-12-04)

    Allow setting the path to PGP on the command line when running perl
    Makefile.PL.

PGP::Sign 0.12 (1998-12-02)

    Ensure the path to PGP input by the user during the build process
    overrides any other path to PGP found by the build system.

PGP::Sign 0.11 (1998-11-27)

    Prevent ExtUtils::MakeMaker from spuriously generating a
    PGP::PGP::Sign man page.

    Add ABSTRACT and AUTHOR to Makefile.PL for Perl versions 5.005 and
    higher.

PGP::Sign 0.10 (1998-11-26)

    Fix a bug in finding the PGP version number of a signature.

    Add support for the $PGP::Sign::PGPPATH configuration variable.

    Clean up and reformat the documentation, add information about PGP
    environment variables, and document the lack of support for PGP v5 and
    GnuPG.

    Add a test suite.

PGP::Sign 0.9 (1998-07-05)

    Fix the code for getting the exit status of PGP to call waitpid on a
    specific PID, avoiding getting the status of some other child
    process.

    Explicitly set $/ in case the calling program had it set to something
    odd.

PGP::Sign 0.8 (1997-08-18)

    Explicitly set a umask of 077 in pgp_verify() (and restore it on
    completion) since we're creating temporary files.

    Add a check to pgp_sign() to make sure we got a signature.

PGP::Sign 0.7 (1997-08-15)

    Use O_EXCL when opening files in /tmp to avoid symlink attacks.

PGP::Sign 0.6 (1997-08-15)

    Add support for $PGP::Sign::MUNGE, which says to remove trailing
    whitespace from each line before passing it to PGP.

PGP::Sign 0.5 (1997-07-28)

    Fix some minor documentation nits.

PGP::Sign 0.4 (1997-07-28)

    Change signature verification code to verify detached signatures
    instead of attached ones, and add a $PGP::Sign::TMPDIR variable to
    specify where the temporary files should be created.

    Remove support for $PGP::Sign::ORS, which was a hack that's no longer
    necessary.  Adding newlines before the signature can be done by the
    caller of the module.

    Add a pgp_error() function to retrieve the error message from the last
    command.

PGP::Sign 0.3 (1997-07-27)

    Add pgp_verify().

PGP::Sign 0.2 (1997-07-27)

    Use @PGP::Sign::ERROR correctly to store errors from pgp_sign().

    Add documentation.

    Fix some minor bugs.

PGP::Sign 0.1 (1997-07-27)

    Initial version, only supporting signature creation.
