If the gpg binary found first on the PATH is too old, the tests will be
skipped rather than fail.  This may not always be desirable, since the
module is not usable on such a system without configuration, but the
module can still be configured to use a GnuPG binary found elsewhere and
therefore this doesn't represent an error in the module itself.

The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
present:

* Devel::Cover
* Perl::Critic::Freenode
* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Perl::Critic
* Test::Pod
* Test::Pod::Coverage
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict
* Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
