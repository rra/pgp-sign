Fri Dec  4 20:49:16 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.13 released.

        * Makefile.PL: Add two ugly hacks, one to let someone set the path
        to PGP on the command line of "perl Makefile.PL," and the second
        to strip the resulting extra dependency from the processPL
        section.  Pass the path to PGP to makepm.PL on the command line if
        it's given.

        * makepm.PL: Add support for accepting the path to PGP on the
        command line (and not prompting in that case).

Wed Dec  2 02:11:01 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.12 released.

        * makepm.PL: The path to PGP that the user inputs should override
        any other path to PGP that we find.

Fri Nov 27 15:37:30 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.11 released.

        * Makefile.PL: Added a MAN3PODS directive to prevent MakeMaker
        from generating a PGP::PGP::Sign man page, changed the formatting
        of the 5.005-only section.

Thu Nov 26 03:53:56 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Makefile.PL: Added ABSTRACT and AUTHOR for Perl versions 5.005
        and higher.  This is for the PPD to go with a binary distribution,
        and for Perl Resource Kits.

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.10 released.

        * PGP/Sign.in: Modified to be PGP/Sign.in instead of Sign.pm,
        added special markers for the path to PGP and the version number,
        added support for $PGPPATH, fixed a bug in finding the PGP version
        number of a signature, cleaned up and reformatted the
        documentation, added a note about PGP environment variables, added
        bugs concerning our lack of support for PGP v5 and GPG, added a
        thank you to Andrew Ford in the history section of the
        documentation.

        * README: Added a thank you to Andrew Ford and documentation of
        how to run our new test suite.  That plus the new auto-generation
        of Sign.pm means I had to snip the great paragraph about
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker; ah well, I'll use it somewhere else.

        * Makefile.PL: Run makepm.PL to generate PGP/Sign.pm, tell
        MakeMaker where the actual module is, and get our version number
        from VERSION.pm now.

        * makepm.PL: New file.  Now generate PGP/Sign.pm automatically
        from this file, which finds and prompts for the path to PGP and
        grabs the version from VERSION.pm.

        * VERSION.pm: New file.  We now pull our release version number
        from here rather than the CVS revision of Sign.in.

        * test.pl: New file.  Added a reasonably good test suite that
        works with public and private key rings included with the
        distribution.  Based on work by Andrew Ford.

        * data/message: New file.

        * data/message.asc: New file.

        * data/pubring.pgp: New file.

        * data/secring.pgp: New file.

Sun Jul  5 03:31:57 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.9 released.

        * Sign.pm: Fixed the way I was dealing with open3() file handles
        and $?.  One needs to keep the PID and do an explicit waitpid(),
        or the status you get may be something random.  Also cleaned
        things up a little and explicitly set $/ in case our calling
        program had it set to something odd.

Mon Aug 18 07:18:09 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.8 released.
        
        * Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Added a umask 077 (and restoration of
        umask on completion) since we're creating temporary files.
        (pgp_sign): Added a check to see if we got a signature at all.

Fri Aug 15 02:37:34 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.7 released.

        * Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Changed to use O_EXCL when opening /tmp
        files to avoid symlink attacks.
        
        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.6 released.

        * Sign.pm: Added output() to munge trailing spaces if $MUNGE is
        set, modified write_data() to send everything through output()
        rather than printing it directly, added documentation of the new
        behavior to the PODs.

Tue Jul 29 02:26:39 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: Removed $ORS, which was a hack that we don't need any
        more.  That work should be done by the client, and the client is
        capable of it.  Added a pgp_error() function (not exported by
        default) to retrieve the error message, since that's a cleaner
        user interface.  Changed the signature verification code to verify
        detached signatures, which means we now use temporary files.
        Added a $TMPDIR global variable to specify the directory in which
        to create temporary files.  Changed the documentation to include
        notes about all of this.

Sun Jul 27 13:42:01 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: Broke write_data() off into a separate function, added
        pgp_verify() and tested it, changed the documentation to mention
        it as well.  Fixed a few minor bugs, made to use @ERROR correctly,
        added documentation.
