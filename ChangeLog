2000-02-12  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.16 released.

        * README: Updated for the support of PGP 6.5, added a note about
        the entropy socket when running tests if using GnuPG and egd,
        added a parenthetical about how the build process distinguishes
        between PGP v2 and PGP v6, added another thank you to Andrew
        Gierth for pointing out the extra needed waitpid(), added a thank
        you to J. Porter Clark for the information about egd.  Added notes
        about the whitespace munging differences in GnuPG 0.9.2 and the
        first pass test suite failures under PGP 6.5.  Updated for 0.16.

        * Makefile.PL: Clean up all the additional junk created in data by
        running the test suite with PGP 6.5.

        * makepm.PL: Also look for PGP 6.5, distinguish between PGP 2 and
        PGP 6 by checking its output when run without any arguments, and
        add the PGP6 PGPSTYLE.

        * Sign.in: Added a waitpid() in pgp_verify() to avoid leaving
        zombies behind.  Updated comments and documentation for the new
        support for PGP 6.5.2 and for the change to GnuPG so that it does
        the same whitespace munging as PGP.

2000-02-06  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * test.pl: The signature in test 9 now expected to fail on all
        versions of PGP, as the release GnuPG was changed to follow PGP in
        its handling of whitespace.

Sun Jun 13 12:37:00 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.15 released.

        * README: Added a thank you to Lupe Christoph for the fcntl()
        stuff, fixed a typo, updated for 0.15.

        * Sign.in: Added a call to fcntl() to clear close-on-exec on the
        passphrase pipe in pgp_sign(), needed for Perl 5.005_03.  Added a
        note to the documentation that PGP may want to write randseed.bin
        in its key ring directory.

        * Makefile.PL: Sign.in and Sign.pm moved to the root directory,
        updated ABSTRACT.

        * makepm.PL: Sign.in and Sign.pm moved to the root directory.

Wed Feb 10 00:35:14 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.14 released.

        * PGP/Sign.in: Use long options with GnuPG rather than -bat, add
        --force-v3-sigs so that generated signatures will be compatible
        with PGP 5.0, and added documentation of this.

        * TODO: New file.

        * README: Added a note that binary data isn't supported yet,
        greatly expanded the REQUIREMENTS section now that we support a
        wide variety of PGP implementations, added notes about required
        Perl versions, expanded the INSTALLATION section to cover the
        various options to Makefile.PL and the various things the
        installer is prompted for, broke TESTING out into a separate
        section with notes about the skipped tests, added thank yous for
        Todd Underwood, Monte Mitzelfelt, and Werner Koch, and expanded
        the CONTACTING section.

        * makepm.PL: Search for gpg and pgps as well, set both PGPS and
        PGPV with prompts and guesses for each, prompt for and set
        PGPSTYLE, and pick up overrides to avoid interactivity from a file
        rather than from the command line.

        * Makefile.PL: Added support for PGPS, PGPV, and PGPSTYLE settings
        on the command line, changed to guess a few things if not
        specified and to pass values to makepm.PL via a separate file
        rather than the command line.  Ugly hack to fix Makefile
        dependencies removed, since it's no longer necessary.

Tue Feb  9 19:47:58 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * test.pl: Changed the testing key ID to "testing", added special
        casing on PGPSTYLE for testing signatures of whitespace-munged
        data against unmunged data since GnuPG will still consider the
        signature valid, added two new tests for version 3 and version 4
        DSS signatures, and had GnuPG skip the PGP 2.6.2 RSA signature
        check.

        * PGP/Sign.in: Added support for GnuPG and PGP 5.0.  This involves
        a new PGPSTYLE global variable, support for separate programs for
        signing and verification, and lots of choosing between styles all
        over the code.  The documentation has also been updated to reflect
        this support, including a long note about whitespace munging
        incompatibilities between different versions and warnings about
        potential future API changes for this module.  Also added a SEE
        ALSO section and a thank you to the folks who send in GnuPG
        support originally.

        * data/message.asc.v4: New file.  Version 4 DSS signature.

        * data/message.asc: New file.  Version 3 DSS signature.

        * data/pubring.gpg: New file.  GnuPG key ring for testing.
        data/secring.gpg: New file.
        data/trustdb.gpg: New file.

        * data/pubring.pkr: New file.  PGP 5.0 key ring for testing.
        data/secring.pkr: New file.

        * data/message.sig: Renamed from message.asc; this is the PGP
        2.6.2 RSA signature.

        * data/pubring.pgp: Change key ID of test key to testing, since
        GPG requires at least five characters in the key ID.
        data/secring.pgp: Likewise.

Fri Dec  4 20:49:16 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.13 released.

        * Makefile.PL: Add two ugly hacks, one to let someone set the path
        to PGP on the command line of "perl Makefile.PL," and the second
        to strip the resulting extra dependency from the processPL
        section.  Pass the path to PGP to makepm.PL on the command line if
        it's given.

        * makepm.PL: Add support for accepting the path to PGP on the
        command line (and not prompting in that case).

Wed Dec  2 02:11:01 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.12 released.

        * makepm.PL: The path to PGP that the user inputs should override
        any other path to PGP that we find.

Fri Nov 27 15:37:30 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.11 released.

        * Makefile.PL: Added a MAN3PODS directive to prevent MakeMaker
        from generating a PGP::PGP::Sign man page, changed the formatting
        of the 5.005-only section.

Thu Nov 26 03:53:56 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Makefile.PL: Added ABSTRACT and AUTHOR for Perl versions 5.005
        and higher.  This is for the PPD to go with a binary distribution,
        and for Perl Resource Kits.

        * VERSION.pm: PGP::Sign 0.10 released.

        * PGP/Sign.in: Modified to be PGP/Sign.in instead of Sign.pm,
        added special markers for the path to PGP and the version number,
        added support for $PGPPATH, fixed a bug in finding the PGP version
        number of a signature, cleaned up and reformatted the
        documentation, added a note about PGP environment variables, added
        bugs concerning our lack of support for PGP v5 and GPG, added a
        thank you to Andrew Ford in the history section of the
        documentation.

        * README: Added a thank you to Andrew Ford and documentation of
        how to run our new test suite.  That plus the new auto-generation
        of Sign.pm means I had to snip the great paragraph about
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker; ah well, I'll use it somewhere else.

        * Makefile.PL: Run makepm.PL to generate PGP/Sign.pm, tell
        MakeMaker where the actual module is, and get our version number
        from VERSION.pm now.

        * makepm.PL: New file.  Now generate PGP/Sign.pm automatically
        from this file, which finds and prompts for the path to PGP and
        grabs the version from VERSION.pm.

        * VERSION.pm: New file.  We now pull our release version number
        from here rather than the CVS revision of Sign.in.

        * test.pl: New file.  Added a reasonably good test suite that
        works with public and private key rings included with the
        distribution.  Based on work by Andrew Ford.

        * data/message: New file.

        * data/message.asc: New file.

        * data/pubring.pgp: New file.

        * data/secring.pgp: New file.

Sun Jul  5 03:31:57 1998  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.9 released.

        * Sign.pm: Fixed the way I was dealing with open3() file handles
        and $?.  One needs to keep the PID and do an explicit waitpid(),
        or the status you get may be something random.  Also cleaned
        things up a little and explicitly set $/ in case our calling
        program had it set to something odd.

Mon Aug 18 07:18:09 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.8 released.
        
        * Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Added a umask 077 (and restoration of
        umask on completion) since we're creating temporary files.
        (pgp_sign): Added a check to see if we got a signature at all.

Fri Aug 15 02:37:34 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.7 released.

        * Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Changed to use O_EXCL when opening /tmp
        files to avoid symlink attacks.
        
        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.6 released.

        * Sign.pm: Added output() to munge trailing spaces if $MUNGE is
        set, modified write_data() to send everything through output()
        rather than printing it directly, added documentation of the new
        behavior to the PODs.

Tue Jul 29 02:26:39 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: Removed $ORS, which was a hack that we don't need any
        more.  That work should be done by the client, and the client is
        capable of it.  Added a pgp_error() function (not exported by
        default) to retrieve the error message, since that's a cleaner
        user interface.  Changed the signature verification code to verify
        detached signatures, which means we now use temporary files.
        Added a $TMPDIR global variable to specify the directory in which
        to create temporary files.  Changed the documentation to include
        notes about all of this.

Sun Jul 27 13:42:01 1997  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * Sign.pm: Broke write_data() off into a separate function, added
        pgp_verify() and tested it, changed the documentation to mention
        it as well.  Fixed a few minor bugs, made to use @ERROR correctly,
        added documentation.
