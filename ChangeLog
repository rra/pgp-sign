        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.9 released.

        * Sign.pm: Fixed the way I was dealing with open3() file handles
        and $?.  One needs to keep the PID and do an explicit waitpid(),
        or the status you get may be something random.  Also cleaned
        things up a little and explicitly set $/ in case our calling
        program had it set to something odd.

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.8 released.
        
        * Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Added a umask 077 (and restoration of
        umask on completion) since we're creating temporary files.
        (pgp_sign): Added a check to see if we got a signature at all.

        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.7 released.

        * Sign.pm (pgp_verify): Changed to use O_EXCL when opening /tmp
        files to avoid symlink attacks.
        
        * Sign.pm: PGP::Sign 0.6 released.

        * Sign.pm: Added output() to munge trailing spaces if $MUNGE is
        set, modified write_data() to send everything through output()
        rather than printing it directly, added documentation of the new
        behavior to the PODs.

        * Sign.pm: Removed $ORS, which was a hack that we don't need any
        more.  That work should be done by the client, and the client is
        capable of it.  Added a pgp_error() function (not exported by
        default) to retrieve the error message, since that's a cleaner
        user interface.  Changed the signature verification code to verify
        detached signatures, which means we now use temporary files.
        Added a $TMPDIR global variable to specify the directory in which
        to create temporary files.  Changed the documentation to include
        notes about all of this.

        * Sign.pm: Broke write_data() off into a separate function, added
        pgp_verify() and tested it, changed the documentation to mention
        it as well.  Fixed a few minor bugs, made to use @ERROR correctly,
        added documentation.
